# Bus_Reservation_System

The basic idea of this project is based on FCFS. While booking a ticket for a bus the person that comes first will get the ticket with his desired seat and this process repeats until there are no tickets remaining for the current bus. The people waiting in line for the ticket wait for the bus or pick another bus.
